## CSCI360 - Programming Languages (Fall 2018) - Hendrix College
Solutions and projects for CSCI360, again, by Dr. Brent Yorgey. This course is an
introduction to writing programming languages ind Haskell. From constructing ASTs, parsing, lexing,
dynamic types, static type checking, interpreting statements, and more.

As I worked through the course there is a moment of realization: I could write languages using Haskell. It sneaks
up on you. And it's quite exciting.

## Future work:
